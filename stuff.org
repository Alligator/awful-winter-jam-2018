* Todo
** Features
*** TODO people to rescue
*** TODO fizzle droplets in enclosed areas
    wait droplets can't land on enclosed areas, or are we saying if
    one droplet breaks a wall then another goes through the gap and
    hits a floor tile it fizzles?
    
    ok i think this is done?
*** TODO it's hard to tell that diagonals aren't connected
*** TODO some kinda explosion when droplets hit walls
*** TODO defenses
** Bugs
*** DONE fix droplets being able to land on molasses
*** TODO can't build in enclosed areas
** Done
*** DONE rotation
*** DONE if you spam click you can build more walls than you should be able to
*** DONE shuffle the pieces
*** DONE get one following the mouse with snapping n stuff
*** DONE drop delay
*** DONE molasses!! - done for now..
*** DONE 1 tile border around the edge to stop game breaking stuff
*** DONE droplets

* Ideas etc
** The Great Molasses Flood
** General game flow
   1. Building phase, trying to rescue people.
   2. Molasses spreads
   3. Droplets get launched
   4. Counter-attack
** Molasses starts off in one of the corners, spreads according to some simple rules
** Droplets are fired from the corner where the molasses started
*** If they land in empty spot, droplets create a new square of molasses
*** If they land on a wall, they destroy it
*** If they land in an enclosed space they fizzle
