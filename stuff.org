* Ideas etc
** The Great Molasses Flood
** General game flow
   1. Building phase, trying to rescue people.
   2. Molasses spreads
   3. Droplets get launched
   4. Counter-attack
** Molasses starts off in one of the corners, spreads according to some simple rules
** Droplets are fired from the corner where the molasses started
*** If they land in empty spot, droplets create a new square of molasses
*** If they land on a wall, they destroy it
*** If they land in an enclosed space they fizzle
