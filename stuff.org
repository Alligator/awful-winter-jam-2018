* Todo
** DONE shuffle the pieces
** DONE get one following the mouse with snapping n stuff
** TODO 1 tile border around the edge to stop game breaking stuff
** TODO drop delay
** TODO place name generator hell yeah

* Ideas etc
** Use palette swapping to randomly generate the colours of the two sides each round
** Start off in a city that you have to expand out from, through your districts avoiding their districts?
** At the end of the round count the number of squares in your district that are your colour
   I guess that means you could survive the round but lose on votes?
** Defenses?
   Doesn't seem like you should have cannons or w/e. Lawyers?
** Read up on the history of gerrymandering a bit more
   There might be good weird stuff in there I can base things off of.
